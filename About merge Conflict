Resolving merge conflict

-> Created a new file with same name as of that in branch_1 "git_commands",  this created conflicts between main branch and new branch "branch_1"

-> "git merge branch_1"

-> To resolve merge conflict, updated the file with the content that I wanted the file to have

-> "git add ."

-> "git commit -m "merge conflict resolved" "
